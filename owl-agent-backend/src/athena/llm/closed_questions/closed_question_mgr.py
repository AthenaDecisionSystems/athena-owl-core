# THIS IS THE USE CASE IN WHICH CLOSED QUESTIONS ARE USED:
# 1. given the goal/intent at hand, define the agent state to keep named business entities needed by the decision service
# 2. initialize the named entities as empty or by fetching them by ID from a datasource
# 3. call the decision service iteratively until we reach a conclusion
#   - use closed questions to enrich the business entities stored in the AgentState and needed by the Decision Service

# TODO: instead of representing the data_type attributes, we should have a representation of the different types.
